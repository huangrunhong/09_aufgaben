          <p class="this_year">
            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

                As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
                finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept
                feedback and learn from it.

            The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to
            create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show
            the result to the community.
